## Overview

Welcome to the Icelandic NER repository! Here, you'll find fine-tuned models for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Icelandic, based on the MIM-GOLD-NER dataset. Whether you're into linguistics, AI, or you're just keen on understanding Icelandic texts better, this is the place to be!

## Quick Links
