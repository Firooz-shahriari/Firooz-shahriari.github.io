# Leveraging ParsBERT and Pretrained mT5 for Persian Abstractive Text Summarization ü¶Å

A well-structured summarization dataset for the Persian language consists of 93,207 records. It is prepared for Abstractive/Extractive tasks (like [cnn_dailymail](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/) for English). It can also be used in other scopes like Text Generation, Title Generation, and News Category Classification. Moreover, we tested out this dataset on novel models and techniques.

- mT5: A pretrained encoder-decoder model
- BERT2BERT: A leveraging ParsBERT model as an encoder-decoder architecture.
